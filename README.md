# Face Detection System

## Overview

This project demonstrates a face detection system using Python, OpenCV, and MTCNN. The system captures an image from the user's webcam, detects faces, and displays the image with annotated bounding boxes and keypoints.

## Features

- Captures a photo using the webcam.
- Detects faces in the captured photo using MTCNN.
- Displays the photo with bounding boxes and keypoints around detected faces.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab (for running the code)
- Required libraries: 
  - `mtcnn`
  - `imutils`
  - `numpy`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `google-colab`
  - `matplotlib`

## Installation

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install mtcnn imutils numpy opencv-python matplotlib
